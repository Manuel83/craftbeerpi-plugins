ToggleStep:
  description: This is a very simple plugin that adds a Step to CraftBeerPi called ToggleStep. This step will turn on, turn off, or set the power on any actor, and then immediately continue with the next step. This is useful if you have a need to turn something on like a pump, but then continue execution of other steps without turning that device back off. Or you could turn something on and set the power, and then use another ToggleStep later to turn it back off.

Groups:
  description: With this plugin you can create both Actor Groups and Sensor Groups. When you group actors together, a single group will turn on, turn off, or set power on all actors at the same time. When you group sensors together, a single group will show the average of the sensors within that group. You can even create groups where the members of that group are other groups.
