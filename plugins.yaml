ToggleStep:
  description: This is a very simple plugin that adds a Step to CraftBeerPi called ToggleStep. This step will turn on, turn off, or set the power on any actor, and then immediately continue with the next step. This is useful if you have a need to turn something on like a pump, but then continue execution of other steps without turning that device back off. Or you could turn something on and set the power, and then use another ToggleStep later to turn it back off.

Groups:
  description: With this plugin you can create both Actor Groups and Sensor Groups. When you group actors together, a single group will turn on, turn off, or set power on all actors at the same time. When you group sensors together, a single group will show the average of the sensors within that group. You can even create groups where the members of that group are other groups.

TiltHydrometerPlugin:
  description: Allows your Tilt digital hydrometer to send data to CraftBeerPi 3.0, such as the current temperature and gravity readings. The plugin allows you to create multiple sensors, each of which is associated with a different data type that the Tilt is capturing, so that you can use these sensors as you would any other sensor in CraftBeerPi. You can also use multiple Tilt devices for different fermentation chambers at the same time. See below for setup instructions and some screenshots of the configuration options.

SwitchSensorMashStep:
  description: This is a very simple plugin that adds a second temperature sensor to the MashStep. This step set the kettle temperature based on the sensor previously assigned to the kettle and turn on a secondary actor (ex. pump, etc.). Then the step timer will not start until the secondary sensor value is equal to the kettle sensor value. This is would be useful for a HERMES or similiar system in which you are not directly heating your mash or you are not directly heating your mash with a high-powered heat source.

BrewPi_SSR:
  description: This is the code for a BrewPi plugin for the CraftBeerPi brewing/fermentation controller to make it possible to use BrewPi SSR's. This are 1-wire based SSR-controllers. Normally connected using the "w1-" file based 1-wire software of the pi, but also by connecting using a i2c-hub (The 1 Wire Pi Plus from AB Electronics UK). This creates a more reliable 1-wire infrastructure incase a larger network is needed. It then use owfs and pyowfs.
