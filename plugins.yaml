SwitchSensorMashStep:
  description: This is a very simple plugin that adds a second temperature sensor to the MashStep. This step set the kettle temperature based on the sensor previously assigned to the kettle and turn on a secondary actor (ex. pump, etc.). Then the step timer will not start until the secondary sensor value is equal to the kettle sensor value. This is would be useful for a HERMES or similiar system in which you are not directly heating your mash or you are not directly heating your mash with a high-powered heat source.
